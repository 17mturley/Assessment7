The append function becomes the faster one as the array gets bigger. The append 
function has the time complexity of O(n) because it is directly proportional to 
the size of the input array. This simplifies and optimizes the performance of the 
function. While the insert function has the time complexity of O(n^2) because of 
the use of unshift. This makes it slower as the array grows, making it less optimal.
